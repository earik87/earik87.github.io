Hi! My name is Enis Arik. 

I studied chemistry and I have done extensive research on [laser spectroscopy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WhyLeAoAAAAJ&hl=en). During my PhD, I realized I will be much happier in private sector. In 2018, I started my career as a software engineer at Infor, in Netherlands. 

Apart from my passion in software engineering, I am interested in home - coffee brewing. I like to release my stress by taking my time to prepare and drink fresh coffee. Before the pandemic, I was actively playing soccer and lifting weight. Right now, I enjoy long walks, running, and doing exercise at home.
