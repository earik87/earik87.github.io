Hi! My name is Enis Arik and I am a software engineer. In this blog, I will be writing about software and other things. 

To be a better engineer, I am learning fundamentals of computer science. Here is the list of courses I have taken.
- CS50: Introduction to Computer Science. (completed in 2020)
- Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. (in progress)

I am an active user in stackoverflow helping people for their [CS50 questions](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=Relevance&pagesize=50&q=user%3a11000382%20%5bcs50%5d).

I was interested in data visualization and built [interactive web application](https://visud.herokuapp.com/) to visualize data from my PhD research. See [github repo](https://github.com/earik87/visualize-ultrafast-data).

Apart from software, I am a home coffee-brewer. I like to release my stress with grinding fresh coffee beans and brewing coffee. I like playing soccer. I used to be a goalkeeper, but now I am a defender. Watching movies and tv-series are also my routine. I find amazing to think about the movie that I have watched and making critics about it.
