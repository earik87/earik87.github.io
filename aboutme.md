Hi! My name is Enis Arik and I am a software engineer.

Here is what I like to do professionally;

  - Learning computer science fundamentals.
  - Helping people for their [CS50 questions](https://stackoverflow.com/search?tab=Relevance&pagesize=50&q=user%3a11000382%20%5bcs50%5d) in stackoverflow.
  - I was interested in data visualization and built [interactive web application](https://visud.herokuapp.com/) to visualize data from my PhD research. See [github repo](https://github.com/earik87/visualize-ultrafast-data).

Here is what I liked to do as a hobby;

- I am interested in coffee brewing. I like to release my stress with grinding fresh coffee beans and brewing.
- I am a weight lifter and I play soccer.
- Watching movies and tv-series are also my routine. I find amazing to think about the movie that I have watched and making critics about it.
